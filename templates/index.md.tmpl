# Solace PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance (solacebrokerappliance) Provider

This provider specifically supports the configuration of Solace PubSub+ Appliances. The provider for the Solace Software Event Broker (solacebroker) is available from [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/solaceproducts/solacebroker/latest).

The [Solace PubSub+ Platform](https://solace.com/products/platform/)'s [PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance](https://solace.com/products/event-broker/appliance/)
efficiently streams event-driven information between applications, IoT devices and user interfaces running in cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments 
using open APIs and protocols like AMQP, JMS, MQTT, REST and WebSocket.

Appliances in multiple locations can be linked together in an [Event Mesh](https://solace.com/what-is-an-event-mesh/) 
to dynamically share events across the distributed enterprise.

## Overview

The _solacebrokerappliance_ provider enables you to configure a PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance using Terraform.

-> This _solacebrokerappliance_ provider uses the same [preferred local name](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements#local-names) `"solacebroker"` as 
the [_solacebroker_ provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/solaceproducts/solacebrokerappliance/latest).
This allows Terraform modules to be written that can target either provider. Note that such modules must only use features that are available in both providers.

This provider also offers the possibility to generate an [HCL configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language) file from a preconfigured appliance.

Use the navigation to the left for more information in the guides and for the available provider resources and data sources.

## Limitations

> This version of the PubSub+ Terraform provider is generally available for production services contained within a Message VPN.  Use of any resource not contained within a Message VPN is not supported in production by Solace.

## Minimum appliance version

The minimum required PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance version is 10.4.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/sampleconfig.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

-> All provider configuration values can also be set as environment variables with the same name, but uppercase and with the `SOLACEBROKER_` prefix.
For example, the password attribute can be set via the `SOLACEBROKER_PASSWORD` environment variable.  Values in the configuration take precedence over environment variables.

## HTTP Proxy Support

This provider supports the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` (or the lowercase versions thereof) to configure clients to use the specified proxy server(s).

If the proxy URL contains a [userinfo](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2) subcomponent, the proxy request will pass the provided username and password for proxy authorization.
Example: `https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy:port`
