# Solace PubSub+ Event Broker Appliance (solacebrokerappliance) Provider

The `solacebrokerappliance` provider supports Terraform CLI operations including basic CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) and import.

The provider leverages the [SEMP (Solace Element Management Protocol)](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/Using-SEMP.htm) REST API to configure the PubSub+ event broker. The API reference is available from the [Solace PubSub+ documentation](https://docs.solace.com/API-Developer-Online-Ref-Documentation/swagger-ui/appliance/config/index.html).

This provider supports configuring appliances and will fail if applied against a software event broker. This check may be overridden by specifying the `skip_api_check = true` configuration argument.

## Mapping of SEMP API and Provider Names

Terraform uses the [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) naming scheme, while SEMP uses camel case. Resources and datasource are also prefixed with the provider local name, `solacebroker_`.  For example, `solacebroker_msg_vpn` is the Message VPN resource name and `max_subscription_count` is the attribute for the maximum subscription count, since `MsgVpn` is the SEMP API object name and `maxSubscriptionCount` is the name of the SEMP attribute.

## Event Broker SEMP API Access

The broker SEMP service, by default at port 80 for HTTP and TLS port 443 for HTTPS, must be accessible to the console running Terraform CLI.

The supported access credentials are basic authentication using username and password, and OAuth using a token. The two options are mutually exclusive, and the provider will fail if both are configured.

-> The [user access levels](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/CLI-User-Access-Levels.htm) associated with the credentials used must be properly configured on the broker so that the desired actions are authorized.

## SEMP API Versioning and Provider Event Broker Compatibility

The SEMP API minor version reflects the supported set of objects, attributes, their properties and possible deprecations.

New versions of the PubSub+ event broker with new features typically require a newer SEMP API version that supports the new or updated objects, attributes, etc. The SEMP API version of an event broker version can be determined from the [Solace PubSub+ documentation](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/SEMP-API-Versions.htm#SEMP_v2_to_SolOS_Version_Mapping).

A given version of the provider is built to support a specific version of the SEMP API. For the SEMP API version of the provider and corresponding broker version, refer to the [Version Compatibility section](https://docs.solace.com/Admin/SEMP/Declarative-SEMP.htm#Version) of the Solace PubSub+ documentation.

* Broker versions at the same SEMP API version level as the provider can be fully configured.
* Broker versions at a lower SEMP API version level than the provider can be configured, except for objects or attributes that have been deprecated and removed in the provider's SEMP version. However, configuration will fail when attempting to configure objects or attributes that have been introduced in a later SEMP version than the broker supports.
* Broker versions at a higher SEMP API version level than the provider can be configured for objects or attributes that are included in the provider's SEMP version. Objects or attributes that have been introduced in a later SEMP version will be unknown to the provider. Objects or attributes that have been deprecated in the broker SEMP version may result in configuration failure.

## Object Relationships

Event Broker inter-object references must be correctly encoded in Terraform configuration to have the apply operation work. This requires an understanding of the PubSub+ event broker objects. For more information about each object consult the [SEMP API reference](https://docs.solace.com/API-Developer-Online-Ref-Documentation/swagger-ui/appliance/config/index.html) and especially look for "required" attributes that give a hint to required pre-existing objects.
For example:

```terraform
resource "solacebroker_msg_vpn" "test" {
  # on the resource itself, specify the value
  msg_vpn_name        = "new"
  # ... other attributes
}

resource "solacebroker_msg_vpn_queue" "q" {
  # on dependent resources, specify as a reference so
  # that Terraform creates the referenced object first
  msg_vpn_name    = solacebroker_msg_vpn.test.msg_vpn_name
  # ... other attributes
}
```

## The Broker Object

The Broker object is the `solacebroker_broker` resource. This object contains global configuration for the PubSub+ event broker.

The Broker object differs from all other objects as it always exists for a given broker and can only be updated.

-> Important: only attributes that are specified will be set to their configured value. Unspecified attributes will not be set to their default-attribute value. This may result in `terraform plan` indicating a change to set attributes to default even after an `apply`, for example after removing an attribute from the configuration.

## Default Objects

There are objects that are preexisting defaults and cannot be created or destroyed, only updated. The default Message VPN and the default client profile are examples of this. Any direct attempt to remove these resources will fail. If the parent object is not a default object then deleting that parent will also remove its child default object.

> If, for example, a configuration includes creating a non-default Message VPN and modifying its default client profile, then when destroying the configuration the provider would report an error about removing the client profile. However, the client profile object will be eventually deleted because the whole Message VPN will also be deleted, which includes the default client profile.

## Broker-Defined Attributes

Some attributes don't have a default value. In this case their value will be determined by the broker. Typically, these defaults depend on the broker scaling settings. While Terraform plan and apply operations function the same way as with other attributes, import will set the Terraform state of the attribute to the broker value (instead of null), even if they were set at default. You can use subsequent plan and apply operations to fix this.

## Object Type Attributes

An object type attribute is a collection of attributes, for example `"event_ingress_msg_rate_threshold": { "clear_value": 2000000, "set_value": 5000000 }`. Note that due to Terraform provider framework limitations, there is no error reported when configuring unknown nested attributes in object type attributes.

## Resource Replace Behavior

In-place update of some resources is not possible at configuration change  and instead the resource will be replaced for the change to occur.

Generally, changing a "required" attribute requires the replace of any resource because the changed attribute will identify a new resource. Optional attributes that are marked as "requires-replacement" in the [provider resources documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SolaceProducts/solacebrokerappliance/latest/docs) also cause replace of the resource.

> Important: If a resource is replaced because of a change, its child resources will be deleted and not automatically restored. Running `terraform plan` after the resource has been replaced will reveal the missing child objects to be restored and a subsequent `terraform apply` will be required to restore those child resources. For example, changing the `direct_only_enabled` attribute of the `dmr_cluster` resource will delete all child resources such as `dmr_cluster_link`.

## Importing Resources

When [importing a resource](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) to Terraform, an [ID or import identifier](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import#import-id) is required. Use the navigation to the left to look up the provider import identifier for the required resource.

We recommend using the following procedure to import a resource:

1. Add the desired resource block with the type and a name for the required resource to the Terraform config file. At a minimum, provide the required attributes. The list of required attributes is available from the resource documentation. Alternatively, you can get most attributes for the required resource (except for sensitive ones) from using the [configuration generator](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SolaceProducts/solacebrokerappliance/latest/docs/guides/config-generator).
1. Use the `terraform import` command to get the resource to the state file.
1. Test the new resource by running `terraform plan`. If all the non-default attributes were added correctly it should show no need to update. If there is any diff, then the indicated attributes should be updated until the plan shows no change.

> Note: Terraform import will only write actual values to the state file for attributes that are set to a non-default value. The value of attributes with default value will be imported as `null`.

## PubSub+ Cloud Notes

* Applying a Message VPN resource configuration to a PubSub+ Cloud broker may cause issues with attributes that are not authorized to be set in PubSub+ Cloud. This can be resolved by removing or commenting out the attributes in the configuration that are reported to be conflicting with the authorization access level.
* Similarly, attempting to delete the configuration of a Message VPN using `terraform destroy` is also expected to fail because of the insufficient authorization access level of the PubSub+ Cloud user.

## Notes and Limitations

* Terraform `apply` is not atomic.  If interrupted by a user, failure, reboot, or switchover the configuration changes may be partly applied.  Terraform does not perform rollbacks.
* Terraform must be the authoritative source of configuration.  If there is any overlap between Terraform controlled configuration and either pre-existing configuration or modifications from other management interfaces the behaviour will be undefined.
* Apply operations may impact broker AD performance, especially large changes.  The `request_min_interval` attribute on the provider limits the request rate and can be adjusted to control the impact.
* Application of configuration may cause brief service interruptions to the resources affected.  These can include a queue missing a published message or clients being briefly disconnected.  These outages are no different from a current administrator manually making an equivalent change to a broker.
* Avoid creating multiple resource blocks for the same resource (where all identifying attributes are the same) as this can result in issues: the same broker resource will be present in the state under multiple different Terraform resource names and removing a resource block may cause the resource to be deleted on the broker, while the other resource name in the state still refers to that resource.
